            <h1>HOW WE MET</h1>
            <div class="ourstory-paragraph">
                In Fall of 2012, Chris and Morgan were both attending Florida State University.  Chris was studying Computer Science and Morgan was studying Anthropology.  That fall, both sophomores happened to have two classes together.  In Dr. Glen Doran’s Archaeology course, Chris started a conversation with Morgan.  Over the next few weeks, they began to talk to each other more and more, sharing phone numbers and texting each other when they were not at school.  After hanging out a few times, Morgan invited Chris to a Tacky Sweater Party that her friend was having.  They both donned their wackiest knitwear and by the end of the night, they were a couple.  Ever since then, they have been making each other laugh.

            <h1>THE PROPOSAL</h1>
            <div class="ourstory-paragraph">
                On May 1, 2016, Chris and Morgan organized a picnic with their closest friends at Magnuson Park in Seattle, Washington.  When they arrived, Morgan was unknowingly led to an area overlooking Lake Washington.  Tables with their childhood photos and shared memories lined a pathway leading to Christopher wearing his original tacky sweater from their first date.   Morgan’s mother had flown in from Florida and was standing behind him along with their close friends.  Flowers surrounded him and their favorite love song played in the breeze.  Morgan was taken completely by surprise and brought to tears.  She followed the path to him where he gave a heartfelt speech before getting down on one knee and asking her to marry him.  Morgan’s only reply was “of course.”  They all proceeded to have a wonderful picnic together.
